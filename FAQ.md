# The commands indicated in this README don't work for me! Why?

The  syntax of the commands can be changed between versions, run ``ytdlmusic`` and read the help message. 

# I would like an MP3 format but I only get an M4A format, why?

The ``ffmpeg`` package is required for the MP3 conversion. Install it and retry to launch ytdlmusic.


# With the ``--tag`` option, my filenames keep the YouTube title format. Why?

The ``ffmpeg`` package is required for the tag conversion. Install it and retry to launch ytdlmusic.
